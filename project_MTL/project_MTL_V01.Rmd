# Prior Notes: 
  * Variables are standardized numerically by variance of values in the dataset. 
  * For readability They need to be reinitialized with their actual values. 

# Preprocessing

* 20241204-MTL:
* I'm going to first look at the distributions of what drug each person consumes.
* I'm also going to make a graph so that we can visually see the distribution of types of drug consumption between different persons. 
* Then I'll attempt to run other analysis as necessary.

# 20241204-MTL: I'm also going to clean the data into a new variable separate from
#               the original data (so that the original data will still be
#               accessible), it may be unnecessary and the process may be time
#               consuming, but it will make it more readable for other uses if
#               needed. It's better to have clean readable data vs numerical values
#               that make it harder to distinguish its value in the data.

### Initialize Consumption Values
# *** Consumption is based on a rating scale from 0-6
# *** @JonChang; 20241204-MTL:  I see that you've added a drug usage in your code
#                               which regards those who selected > (greater than) 3 as 1: regular usage
#                               and those < (less than) 3 are encoded as 0: non-regular. The non-regular
#                               is a bit vague, as non-regular could mean more than the norm or less than
#                               the norm. In this case, it would be better to just say less-regular, I'm
#                               assuming that you plan to create a usage column to asses each individual
#                               persons' consumption of a drug.

# Consumption values will be encoded as 0:less-regular, 1:regular. 
# Note a categorical values isn't truly necessary, also if the values are numerical
# it simplifies coding the data. (you can just think of 0 as not regular, and 1 as regular)
